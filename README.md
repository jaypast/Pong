# Pong Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Node.js and the `node-ncurses` package for terminal rendering.

## Installation

Before you can run the game, you will need to install Node.js and the `node-ncurses` package.

### Node.js

You can download and install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org

### node-ncurses

To install `node-ncurses`, run the following command:

```
npm install node-ncurses
```

## Usage

To start the game, run the following command in your terminal:

```
node pong.js
```

The game will start immediately and you can use the following controls to play:

- Use the up and down arrow keys to move the right paddle up and down.
- Use the 'w' and 's' keys to move the left paddle up and down.
- Press the 'q' key to quit the game.

The goal of the game is to hit the ball with your paddle and make it past your opponent's paddle. Each time the ball passes your opponent's paddle, you score a point. The first player to reach 10 points wins the game.

Good luck and have fun!
